                                    \ is used, no quantity may represent a number\
                                    \ greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it\
                                    \ have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger\
                                    \ or more precise will be capped or rounded up.\
                                    \ (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may\
                                    \ be extended in the future if we require larger\
                                    \ or smaller quantities.\n\nWhen a Quantity is\
                                    \ parsed from a string, it will remember the type\
                                    \ of suffix it had, and will use the same type\
                                    \ again when it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing,\
                                    \ Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\".\
                                    \ This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted\
                                    \ up or down (with a corresponding increase or\
                                    \ decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n  a. No precision\
                                    \ is lost\n  b. No fractional digits will be emitted\n\
                                    \  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as\
                                    \ possible.\nThe sign will be omitted unless the\
                                    \ number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n  1.5 will\
                                    \ be serialized as \"1500m\"\n  1.5Gi will be\
                                    \ serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that the quantity\
                                    \ will NEVER be internally represented by a floating\
                                    \ point number. That is the whole point of this\
                                    \ exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values will still\
                                    \ parse as long as they are well formed, but will\
                                    \ be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always\
                                    \ use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\nThis\
                                    \ format is intended to make it difficult to use\
                                    \ these numbers without writing some sort of special\
                                    \ handling code in the hopes that that will cause\
                                    \ implementors to also use a fixed point implementation."
